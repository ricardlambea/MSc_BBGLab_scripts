# MSc_BBGLab_scripts
Scripts used while I was working at BBGLab on the copy-number variants project.

This repo is basically a place to save all the scripts I had created/used during my master's final project at BBGLab.
There are scripts written in different languages and there is not a lineal relationship between them, so they are not organized in a specific order.
